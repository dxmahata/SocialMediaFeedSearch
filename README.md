SocielMediaFeedSearch
=====================

Integrating the search of different social media public feeds

This is an effort to integrate the search feeds of different social media websites like:

a. GooglePlus
b. Twitter
c. Facebook
d. Flickr
e. Different Blog Sites

enabling the collection of streaming data produced. The module is being developed as part of my research project, 
which is a generic framework for collecting and managing identity information of real-life entities from Social Media.

My other intention is to develop this module as a full fledged independent application that enables
researchers to collect public social media data from diverse platforms. Researchers often face problems
in understanding the individual APIs of different social media web sites. Moreover, the authentication
process might be sometimes daunting. This module when fully developed should allow to collect data
from a given social media channel with minimum overhead. Would also like to give the option of configuring
the module and allowing to store the data in different formats and in different databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4j).
